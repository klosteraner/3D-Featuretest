* 3D-Featuretest
*
* A small Gadget to manipulate 3D data.
*
*******************************************************************
*
* Is mainly a first try to outline a softwareproject.
* The mainuse is to have some familiar reference cooking plate 
* for futureprojects.
*
* In its first version it should be able to read/write .ply files
* to the locally used CGAL halfedge datastructure as well as provide
* an interface to manipulate the data by MCF.
*
* In a second version the manipulator should be generalized to some
* more functions. Additionally it should resolve issues appearing in
* the development of the first version.
